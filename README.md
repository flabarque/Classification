# Classification

**Classification** - Chapter III - "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (2nd Edition)" by Aurélien Géron

In this chapter the authors worked through the MNIST dataset, to illustrate the main steps of Classification Systems.

We will use the MNIST dataset that is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.

**Labels**:

* each image is labeled with the digit it represents

**Model Prediction**:

Digit, given an image.
